> **Credit**: ThinLine Radio is built on the foundation of [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) by [Chrystian Huot](https://github.com/chuot). The core scanner functionality, database schema, delayed audio system, alert sounds, and API compatibility are based on the original Rdio Scanner project.

> **Important Notice**: When the Rdio Scanner project stagnated, we reached out to collaborate and help maintain the codebase. Our offer was declined, and we were subsequently threatened with legal action by the original developer despite Rdio Scanner being an open source project under GPL v3. As a result of these actions, **ThinLine Radio operates as an independent project in its own repository** and we will not contribute to the original Rdio Scanner project or collaborate with its developer. We acknowledge the original codebase foundation while maintaining our rights under the GPL v3 license. For Rdio Scanner support, please refer to the original project.

# What is it ?

**ThinLine Radio** is a comprehensive radio scanner platform built on the foundation of [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner), an open source software that ingests and distributes audio files generated by various software-defined radio recorders. ThinLine Radio extends the original Rdio Scanner with enterprise-grade features including user accounts, billing, transcription services, advanced alerting, and multi-tenancy support.

The interface tries to reproduce the user experience of a real police scanner, while adding modern SaaS capabilities.

You can listen to ThinLine Radio on any modern browsers using the integrated web app.

# Features

ThinLine Radio includes all the core features from Rdio Scanner v7, plus extensive enhancements:

## Core Version 7.0 Features (Original Rdio Scanner Project)

- **Database Schema**: Complete rewrite with new database structure
- **Delayed Audio**: Configurable delay system for live audio streaming
- **Alert Sounds**: Built-in alert sound system
- **Multi-Group Talkgroups**: Support for talkgroups across multiple groups
- **LED Colors**: Customizable LED color system
- **API Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing integrations
- **Angular 15**: Modern frontend framework
- **Simplified Imports**: Streamlined import processes
- **#UNITLBL Metatag**: Enhanced unit labeling support

## ThinLine Dynamic Solutions Enhancements & Additions

- **Client-Side Persistence**: Enhanced local storage and state management
- **Radio Reference DB Import**: Direct integration with Radio Reference database

## Default System Delay

ThinLine Radio supports a configurable default delay that applies to all systems and talkgroups:

- **Global Default**: Set a default stream delay in **MINUTES** for all systems and talkgroups
- **Stream Delay**: Delays live audio streaming to clients (not recording delay)
- **Priority System**: Individual system and talkgroup delays override the default
- **Flexible Configuration**: Set to 0 to disable, or any positive number for minutes
- **Admin Interface**: Easily configure via the admin options page
- **Real-time Application**: Changes take effect immediately for new calls

**Important**: This delay affects the live audio stream sent to clients, not the recording or storage of calls. It's useful for compliance with broadcasting regulations or to allow time for emergency response coordination.

This feature simplifies delay management by providing a global fallback while maintaining the flexibility of individual system and talkgroup settings.

# Recorders compatibility

ThinLine Radio works with any radio recorder that is compatible with [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner), as long as they can create audio files separated by conversations or transmissions.

Here is a list of recorders known to work:
